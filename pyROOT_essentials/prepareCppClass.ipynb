    "Since we're doing a dijet analysis, we'll want to use TLorentzVectors to do things like computing the invariant mass of a two-jet system. But TLorentzVectors are notoriously slow in pyROOT. Even if this weren't the case, looping over big trees is really something you should never do in pyROOT. But pretty much everything besides those CPU-intensive tasks is better in pyROOT :-P\n",

    "Please take a look at the minimal changes made to `hatsTrees.C` and `hatsTrees.h` that you can find in the `sample_code` directory. A good philosophy with using `TTree.MakeClass()` is to change as little as possible. Please read the below diff -- it contains useful tips on e.g. setting up the class to take arguments. Without the comments, there are about 30 lines of code added, but they're sufficient for all the heavy lifting in the calculation of complicated physical variables."

rootpy essentials
=================

Quoting from the [rootpy poject page](http://www.rootpy.org/index.html): *The PyROOT bindings introduced ROOT into the world of Python, however, interacting with ROOT in Python should not feel like you are still writing C++*
This tutorial closely follows the exercises present in ```pyROOT_essentials``` to allow an easy comparison between the bare pyROOT and the rootpy bindings. ```rootpy``` does not only provide an easier and more pythonic way of writing ROOT code, but makes significant improvements in the execution speed for certain pyROOT known bottlenecks.
Please start out with the notebook [firstLook_rootpy.ipynb](firstLook_rootpy.ipynb), which is a rewrite of the pyROOT version [firstLook.ipynb](../firstLook.ipynb)

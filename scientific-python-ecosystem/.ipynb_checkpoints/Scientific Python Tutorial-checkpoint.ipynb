    "# Scientific Python Ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past 5 years or so, Python has become a popular way to do science. The language had always been regarded as slow, and therefore unfit for large-scale numerical work, but extensions written in C++ soften that issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key component underlying this ecosystem is the Numpy array, which defines a standard way to work with raw numerical arrays. SciPy (scientific algorithms), Matplotlib (plotting), Pandas (dataframe-style interaction), and Scikit-Learn (machine learning) are all built on top of this format. Numpy is as pervasive in the scientific Python ecosystem as ROOT is in HEP.\n",

    "# How to access these packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific Python packages are not a part of the standard Python library— not even plotting. I don't recommend installing them manually or even using your OS distribution's package manager (such as yum or apt-get). Use one of these specialized package managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **pip:** Usually, you would install Python packages with pip, and many of these packages are installable that way. However, pip only tracks Python dependencies, and most of these packages depend on non-Python libraries.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * **conda:** The `conda` package manager was invented for this problem: it tracks dependencies from any language (a conda package need not be Python: [ROOT is a conda package](https://nlesc.gitbooks.io/cern-root-conda-recipes/content/index.html)), and it keeps track of hardware architecture so that compilations will succeed. The [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) could be used as an unambiguous definition of what is \"scientific Python\" and what is not. [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) is a way to conda-install things without the whole ecosystem.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   (\"Continuum Analytics,\" a name that pops up a lot on Anaconda/Miniconda, is a company built up around Numpy, founded by Numpy's developer. The nonprofit organization associated with this stuff is called [PyData](https://pydata.org/).)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * **CMSSW:** Surprisingly, CMSSW already contains many of these. Since you're CMS members, this might be the easiest way to get access to these packages. I'm only going to show packages from within CMSSW because that way, we don't have to install anything to get started.\n",
